Maxim is a professional engineer and experienced project manager with over 8 years of experience in the sectors of water, environment and energy. His key specialization areas include designing, managing and deploying rural infrastructure projects and studies mainly through his work in multiple countries in Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia.

Since 2015, as Project Manager and then Field Team Leader, he led the scoping, design, contract negotiation and implementation of a large-scale regional project focused on improving access to energy in rural areas of Burkina Faso. This 4-year, USD 14M project aims to contribute to sustainable economic growth in the Boucle du Mouhoun region by extending the national grid, installing off-grid energy solutions and supporting the development of renewable energy-enabled local economic development activities with an estimated 50,000 direct and 250,000 beneficiaries.

Prior to that, Maxim designed and managed a complex water supply and sanitation project in public and private partnership with the Government of Canada, a large mining company and a private foundation for the technical delivery of a 200 m3/hr water treatment plant providing clean drinking water to over 60,000 town inhabitants. Maxim also led the development and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) technologies using mobile phones and tablets on projects and studies implemented by Cowater, and provided technical training on hydraulic modelling and GIS to various government agencies. These included mobile-to-web solutions for field data collection and surveys with over 10,000 respondents. He gained significant training experience designing and delivering training programs to enable project partners and stakeholders to effectively leverage mobile technologies and applications in their activities.

Maxim has experience delivering technical inputs and managing projects funded by various international donors including the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, Global Affairs Canada and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. He also led the development of innovative public-private partnerships, including with independent power producers (IPP) and mining companies in Africa.
